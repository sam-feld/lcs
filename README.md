# Assignment Instructions - Longest Common Subsequence
### Problem:

Write a program that reads in three strings and outputs the longest common subsequence among those three strings.

You can assume the three strings use just the letters A-Z.
Ties can be broken arbitrarily. That is, any common subsequence of the same longest length is acceptable.
Assignment is due by Friday (2/16) before class as we will review the solution on Friday.

### Sample Run 1:

``` 
PS> java LCS3 EXAMPLE STAPLER MAPLE
Longest common subsequence is APLE
Length of longest common subsequence is 4
 ```


### Sample Run 2:

``` 
PS> java LCS3 CAAGCTGTA TAACGGCTC ATCCTGTTTA
Longest common subsequence is ACGT
Length of longest common subsequence is 4
```
